# SetVectorAlgorithms
This repository contains Python solutions for two algorithmic problems:
1. **Sum of Distinct Elements**: Computes the sum of elements present in only one of two given sets using arrays.
2. **Dot Product and Orthogonality Check**: Calculates the dot product of vectors and checks if pairs of vectors are orthogonal.
